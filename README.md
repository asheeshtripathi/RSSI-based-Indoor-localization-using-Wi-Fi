# RSSI-based-Indoor-localization-using-Wi-Fi
Estimation of a receiver node Location based on the RSSI of the Wi-FI signals from Access Points. We calculated path loss factor from the received and transmitted power relationship. Receiver node measures the received RSSI and based on calculated path loss factor, distance from four access point is estimated. Then, from multidimensional scaling in MATLAB, we plotted the location of the receiver and four access point. we compared the actual measured location(based on measured distance matrix) and estimated location(based on RSSI distance calculation) to get the localization error. We used Linksys EA4500 routers as access points and laptop with Acrylic WiFi home software to measure RSSI
